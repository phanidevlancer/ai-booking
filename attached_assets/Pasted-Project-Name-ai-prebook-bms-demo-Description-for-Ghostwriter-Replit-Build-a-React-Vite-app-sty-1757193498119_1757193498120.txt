Project Name: ai-prebook-bms-demo

Description for Ghostwriter / Replit
Build a React + Vite app styled like BookMyShow (dark theme, card-based layout). The app should show upcoming movies with real posters, each card having two CTAs:

“Book Now” → (just placeholder, normal flow)

“AI Pre-Book” → Opens our AI-powered pre-booking form

Requirements

UI Theme:

Dark background (#121212) with red (#E50914) as accent color (similar to BookMyShow).

Movie posters in a grid (3–4 columns).

Rounded cards with hover effect.

Movie Data:
Use real posters + titles (hardcode them as dummy data). Example:

“Deadpool & Wolverine” (poster: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/hPtPOA0RTnV6hO5v3hF1rUuRtnO.jpg)

“Inside Out 2” (poster: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/djhPTGoBsq0hwg5r3Iqh9CzRBY0.jpg)

“Pushpa 2” (poster: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/84nmyqRQltOelF8RoqfoBx3Y7cY.jpg)

“Kalki 2898 AD” (poster: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/eoNRk8r2raXI5Qun7qY5T2r8j04.jpg)

Pages & Flow:

Home (Upcoming Movies)

Grid of movie posters with name & release date.

Buttons: “Book Now” and “AI Pre-Book”.

AI Pre-Book Form

Selected movie header (poster + title).

Fields:

Multi-select theaters (use dummy theater names like PVR Forum Mall, INOX GVK One, etc.).

Tickets count (stepper).

Seat preference (adjacent / allow split).

Time range selector (slider 9:00 → 23:30).

Dates (multi-select calendar).

UPI ID input.

CTA: “Pay Pre-Booking Fee” → goes to confirmation screen.

Pre-Booking Confirmation

Success message: “Your pre-booking is confirmed! We’ll notify you once seats are found.”

Buttons: View My Pre-Bookings | Back to Home.

Dashboard (My Pre-Bookings)

Shows list of pre-bookings with statuses: Pending, Searching, Match Found, Confirmed.

Admin toggle: “Open bookings for this movie” (simulates release).

If match found → Show “View Match”.

Match Found Screen

Seat map screenshot placeholder.

Movie details, theater, date, time.

Price breakdown (tickets + service fee).

QR Code (generated with qrcode npm lib).

Buttons: Pay & Confirm | Not Interested | Try Other Theaters.

Booking Confirmed Screen

Final e-ticket with QR code + ticket details.

Automation (Dummy):

Background job (setInterval) checks if “bookings open” toggle is ON.

If so, generate fake seat allocation and mark as “Match Found”.

Packages to install:

react-router-dom for navigation

qrcode.react for QR codes

tailwindcss for styling

Style Guide (BookMyShow-like):

Dark theme (bg-[#121212] text-white)

Movie titles in bold white, secondary text in gray

Red buttons (bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700) for primary actions

Rounded poster cards with hover scale effect

Consistent spacing (use Tailwind grid & flex utilities)
